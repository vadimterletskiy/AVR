@brief Library of A/D conversion functions for the Atmel microcontrollers.

This library provides basic functions for performing A/D conversions in the
following ways:

-# Single A/D conversion of one or a group of channels. This starts
the conversion and returns. An ISR reads the result to a temporary
location. This way either interrupt driven or polled mode can be used in
the application.

-# Free running A/D conversion. Once started the A/D converter continues to
restart automatically. Channel scanning can be used, in which case all
channels are scanned before proceeding to the next round of conversions.
The program is responsible for picking up the results before they are
overwritten. This can be useful for obtaining data at the maximum rate.

The functions are non-blocking. Once the A/D converter is started, a read
function can be used to check that conversion is complete and will return
to the main program flow.

ADC_DYNAMIC_CLOCK indicates whether the clock rate is defined in code or in
a C macro. In the former case, it can be changed on the fly by the program
if needed. Most of the time a fixed rate is adequate.

ADC_FREERUN_MODE is a mode used by the AVRs to chain ADC conversions. This
may be useful if a number of conversions are used to produce an average
value for example.

ADC_SLEEP_MODE is used to place the microcontroller into a sleep state
during conversion, to reduce digital noise.

Some AVRs also have external or internal triggers for the ADC, this is not
used in this library.

/**  @brief  Start an A/D conversion.

This function will initiate conversion of a group of channels defined by the
channel mask. It makes use of parameters set by the adcInit function.
All channels represented by the channelMask are scanned consecutively.
The first conversion after initialization is slightly different to any later
ones, as it takes about twice as long. The ADC must be idle otherwise it
returns a NOT_READY indication.

The ISR will take over the initiation of consecutive channel scans. The
recommended action for free running mode is to change the channel in the ISR
as it is guaranteed to have allowed sufficient time for the converter to
read its configuration. However this will cause the channel to be changed for
the NEXT conversion, so we need to keep track of this.

Using sleep mode along with free running mode is problematical for this library
and is not practicable, even though it is not prevented. Here it will only
sleep for the first conversion which is discarded anyway.

The adcInit function must be called first. No checks are made on this.

Blocking can be implemented simply by placing the call in a loop. On multiple
channel scans it would be wise to poll each channel in the same order as the
ISR uses, that is, lowest to highest. Be careful of free running mode as the
first channel is scanned twice immediately after activation.

The variable adcValid acts as a status indicator for the channel data. The ISR
will set the bit corresponding to the specified channel when the data has been
accessed (irregardless of whether the bit is already set), and the read
function will clear it. This allows the ISR to signal the availability of the
data, particularly during free running mode.

The ISR reads the result from the A/D converter and stores it in the
appropriate result array location. A result flag bit is set to indicate what
channels have been read and which are still to be completed. The next channel
in a scan, if any, is selected and another conversion started.

If freerun mode is active, then when a channel change is made, the conversion
is already taking place and the change will not take effect until the next
cycle. Therefore we must keep a record of the previous channel as the current
conversion result will be for that channel, not the current one.

The scan mask keeps a list of channels to be scanned. When a channel
conversion is completed the mask is bit shifted to find the next channel. A
flag is set for that channel in the adcDataValid byte. When the data is
retrieved for the channel, that bit is reset. If data is not retrieved in
time, it is overwritten by the next scan of the channel.
